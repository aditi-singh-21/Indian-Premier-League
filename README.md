# 🏏 Indian Premier League (IPL) Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing the **Indian Premier League (IPL)** match-by-match dataset from the seasons **2008 to 2019**. The analysis aims to uncover various insights about teams, players, and match trends over the years.

## 📊 Project Overview

The dataset used in this analysis was sourced from **Kaggle** and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/nowke9/ipldata). It consists of two files:

- **deliveries.csv**: Contains ball-by-ball data of all matches.
- **matches.csv**: Contains match-level data for each IPL game.

For this analysis, we primarily used the **matches.csv** file, which provides information such as match results, teams, player awards, venues, and toss details.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Tasks

The following key EDA tasks were performed to extract insights from the IPL dataset:

### 1. Maximum Number of Wins by a Team in a Season
- Analyzed which team secured the maximum number of wins in each IPL season.
- Visualized season-wise performance trends of different teams.

### 2. Most Matches Hosted by a Stadium
- Determined which stadium hosted the highest number of IPL matches over the years.
- Explored venue trends and identified popular stadiums for hosting IPL games.

### 3. Teams with the Most Wins
- Identified which team has won the most matches in IPL history.
- Calculated the win percentage of each team to compare overall performance.

### 4. Player with the Most Man of the Match (MoM) Awards
- Analyzed which player received the highest number of **Man of the Match** awards.
- Provided insights into top-performing players across different seasons.

### 5. Team-wise Toss Statistics and Decision Analysis
- Examined toss-winning statistics for each team and their choices (batting or fielding first).
- Analyzed the correctness of toss decisions based on match outcomes.

## 📈 Results and Insights
- The analysis revealed consistent top-performing teams, key players, and popular venues.
- Identified trends in toss decisions and their impact on match outcomes, providing strategic insights.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and generating insightful plots.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Extend the analysis to include data from more recent IPL seasons.
- Perform predictive analysis to forecast match outcomes based on historical data.
- Incorporate data from **deliveries.csv** for more granular analysis, such as player performance metrics.
